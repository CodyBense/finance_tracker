# **FInance Tracker**

This is a quick and simple finacne tracker I am writing in python.
I will grab the data from csv files, or what ever I can download from my banks give me, to break down my finances and track how I am spending my money.

## TODO
- [x] Figure out the format of files that my bank will give me
    - [ ] See if I can automate their download
- [ ] Figure out how to parse data
    - [ ] maybe use pandas
- [ ] After parsing data sort into categories
- [ ] Break down expenses v income
- [ ] Compare monthly spending
